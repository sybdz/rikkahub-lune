# Skill Creator

Use this when the task is about authoring or revising a skill.

## Workflow

1. Identify the skill's trigger condition and keep it specific.
2. Create one directory per skill under `skills/`.
3. Write `SKILL.md` with required YAML frontmatter:
   - `name`
   - `description`
4. Keep the body concise. Put only workflow, decision rules, and validation steps in `SKILL.md`.
5. Prefer progressive disclosure:
   - Keep `SKILL.md` short.
   - Move long examples or references into `references/`.
   - Put reusable automation in `scripts/`.
6. Add `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`, `author`, and `version` when they materially improve execution and provenance.
7. Before packaging, validate that the skill still has at least one activation path.
8. For zip sharing, package the whole skill directory with `SKILL.md` at the skill root.

## Template

```md
---
name: "example-skill"
description: "Use when the user needs ..."
allowed-tools: "Read"
---

# Overview

State when to use the skill, what to inspect, and the steps to follow.
```

## Quality Bar

- Prefer short, high-signal instructions over long explanations.
- Do not create extra docs like README or changelog unless the task explicitly needs them.
- If variants exist, keep `SKILL.md` brief and move detailed material into `references/`.
- If shell access is needed, declare it explicitly in `allowed-tools`.
- If a task can be validated, include a short verification step instead of leaving success implicit.
